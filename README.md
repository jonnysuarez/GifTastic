# GifTastic-

What my project does:
Giftastic is a page that will return 10 Gifs based on a set of default buttons and new buttons create by user input. The theme is video games.

How it works:
When a user clicks one of the default buttons 10 gifs are returned from the Giphy api and displayed on the DOM.

The gifs are initially displayed as still images until the user clicks on them and they will begin to play. They will continue to loop unless clicked again.

The user may also add custom searches by adding a video game title to the user input area and clicking submit. This will add a button to the DOM with the search term and act just as the default buttons do.
